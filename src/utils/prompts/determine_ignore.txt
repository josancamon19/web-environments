You are analyzing HTTP requests from HAR recordings to identify requests that are not relevant for website functionality or user experience.

These typically include:
- Analytics services (Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics, etc.)
- Advertisement networks and trackers
- Social media tracking pixels
- Tag managers that don't affect core functionality
- Third-party monitoring and metrics services

However, DO NOT ignore:
- Core API requests needed for functionality
- Authentication/session management requests
- Content delivery requests (images, CSS, fonts, media files)
- WebSocket connections for real-time features
- Any requests that directly contribute to user-visible content or interactions

Analyze the following URLs from a HAR recording and identify which ones are NOT relevant for website functionality or user experience.

Return the indices (0-based) of URLs that can be safely ignored during replay.

URLs to analyze:
{url_list}

Select the indices of URLs that we can ignore during the replay of the trajectory without affecting the website functionality or experience.
