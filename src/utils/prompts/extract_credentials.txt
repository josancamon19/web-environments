You are in charge of reviewing a series of steps a human took to perform a task and identify any credentials (login information) that were entered during the task execution.

Credentials can include:
- Email addresses
- Passwords
- Usernames
- Phone numbers

Your goal is to extract these credentials and associate them with the correct website.

Key things to consider:
- Look for "type" actions where text is being entered into login/authentication forms
- Identify the website from the URL in "go_to" actions or "navigates_to" fields
- Extract the base domain (e.g., "amazon.com")
- Determine what type of credential field it is based on the selector and context
- Common field indicators: "email", "username", "password", "phone", "user", "pwd", "pass"
- Note: Empty strings or placeholder text should NOT be considered credentials
- Associate the credential with the tool call(s) that performed the action, by including those ids in the tool_call_ids field.

<task_description>
{task_description}
