You are in charge of reviewing a series of steps a human took to perform a task and identify the steps in the series that are most likely to be the most important for the human to have performed to complete the task.

These steps are checkpoints that we could assume the human achieved part of the task.

The checkpoints you extract will be used to evaluate the performance of other humans and language models, make sure you consider this when selecting the checkpoints.

Key things to consider to determine importance of a step:
- Your rationale of the whole set of steps and the key actions or events that have more likely determine the completion of the task.
- The tool call action that was performed
- Consider "navigates_to" field and weight its relevance
- Consider the "timestamp" difference between tool_calls, might indicate longer wait times, more complex reasoning from the human, etc. But could also indicate a longer loading time, or network latency, so evaluate accordingly.

Note: The step 0 or tool_call with type go_to should not be considered a checkpoint, cause that's the minimum expected, to open a browser page.
